# Planning

### Learning Objectives
- TypeScript
- React Router
- Spotify API
- OAuth 2.0
- WebSockets
- Async Await

### Next Steps
- Use refresh token if access token has expired
- User can pause + start playback from app
- Other users pause + stop playback from app

### Bugs
- If the authorized user has more than one session tab open, sends multiple spotify API requests
