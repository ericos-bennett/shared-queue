# Planning

### Learning Objectives
- TypeScript
- React Router
- Spotify API
- OAuth 2.0
- WebSockets
- Async Await

### Next Steps
- Add copy to homepage
- Restyle homepage
- Restyle room page
- Sync up track, isPlayed, and progressMs for new user when they join
- Set up on Heroku, run more tests in production (deploy directly from GitHub master)

### Bugs
- If the authorized user has more than one session tab open, sends multiple spotify API requests
- Clicking next/prev while paused doesn't change image or playback progress bar
- Deleting the playing track should move playback to next track in playlist
